# **A**uto**P**ull: **A** stu**p**id tool (to save your life).

> NOTE: Alpha stage now, need more test.

You might encounter this situation:

```
forked from BlaBla...
This branch is 18 commits ahead, 22 commits behind ...
```

I want to auto pull upstream and merge it to origin.

If can fast-forward, then push.

Else, abort and reset.

For my personal use, but the source code is easily read and can be easily modified to meet your flavor.

Issues and PRs are welcome.
