# AutoPull: A stupid tool to save your time.

You might encounter this situation:

```
forked from BlaBla...
This branch is 18 commits ahead, 22 commits behind ...
```

I want to auto pull upstream and merge it to origin.

If can fast-forward, then merge and push. Else, abort and reset to HEAD.

You can config your repos in `config.json`.

You can modify your pull & push procedure in `main.py`.

For my personal use, but the source code is easily read and can be easily modified to meet your flavor.

Issues and PRs are welcome.
